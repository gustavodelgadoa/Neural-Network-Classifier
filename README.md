# CIFAR-10 Neural Network Classifier

A fully-connected neural network classifier built with PyTorch to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. This project implements a deep learning model using only linear (fully-connected) layers, without convolutional operations.

## Project Overview

This project implements a command-line neural network classifier that can:
- Train a multi-layer neural network on the CIFAR-10 dataset
- Achieve ≥45% test accuracy using only fully-connected layers
- Save trained models for later use
- Classify individual images from command-line input

## Preliminary

Download packages needed: pip install torch torchvision
